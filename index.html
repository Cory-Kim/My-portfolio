        <h3>Fullstack development</h3>
        <p>
          When I studied at BCIT, I had a project course in which I had to form a group of 4 people to create an
          app that can give a positive influence on problems raising near us. Our group eventually come up with an
          idea that it would be nice to not waste all the leftover food. So we made an app that restaurant owner
          can register their restaurants and customer can arrange a meeting at night to buy food at a cheap price.
          This is a win-win situation for both owner and customer because the owner can sell food that has to be thrown away
          anyway and people can buy food at a cheap price.

        <h3>Leetcode</h3>
        <p>
          This might not be the most efficient way of learning the programming as I heard some people saying that 
          Leetcode is just for passing interview but it actually helped me to improve my programming skills a lot.
          It made me understand concepts such as hashmap, stack, trees. At first, I wasn't able to solve easy questions
          but now I made my own answers to a few questions.

        <h3>Different programming languages</h3>
        <p>
          On my time at BCIT, I learned lots of new programming languages. It was really challenging because professors were
          teaching at really fast pace. It was hard to catch up at times but as I study, I was not only able to learn lots of
          languages, but an ability to learn something new quickly. I found this trait especially valuable because IT world
          changes fast over the time and in order to keep up, it's necessary to learn knowledgy quickly. Over the years, I was able
          to learn Python, Java, C++,  C,  Node js, PHP, AngularJS, SQL, Node JS, MongoDB, Firebase, Javascript, CSS, JQuery, and Redux.

    <div class="about-me__body">
      <p>Since I was young, my dream has been to become a doctor. 
        I don’t know if it’s because of the unknown influence from my parent 
        as my parents wanted me to become a doctor like many parents in Asia do. As I go to school, 
        I noticed that, unlike most other students, I weirdly liked Math more than all the subjects. 
        I felt like all other subjects require me to memorize new words and concepts while in Math, 
        I use few formulas to draw out the answer. I especially liked how I can solve complex problems in step by step. 
        As I age, I begin to accept the fact that I wasn’t smart enough to become a doctor and I studied nursing at university. 
        At this point, I still felt like I should at least get a job in the medical field. But, as time goes, 
        I became more and more depressed as I just didn’t find my studying fun. One day, I was watching Youtube, 
        and learning about basic programming came up as my recommended video. Without much thinking, 
        I clicked the video and watched the whole 5 hours video. After watching the video, 
        I was surprised that I learned a lot by just watching the Youtube video. 
        I felt like it’s interesting how you build a program step by step just like Math. From this day, my programming journey started. 
        It was a bit late but I am glad that I finally found something that I like. I decided to pursue the dream of becoming a programmer. 
        So far I have learned Java, C, C++, PHP, Node JS, Jquery, Javascript, CSS, HTML, SQL, Bootstrap, Git/GitHub, and Linux.
        I’ve started learning new languages like MongoDB, and Angular. 
        I am still very enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages and frameworks.</p>
